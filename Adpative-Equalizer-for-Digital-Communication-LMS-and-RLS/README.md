Description of problem 

---

Our goal is to deal with narrowband digital communications using linear modulation in the presence of multipath.

With symbol rate sampling at the receiver, the received signal may be expressed as

where d[n] is the sequence of transmitted symbols.

q[n] is the symbol-rate sampled version of the multipath distorted pulse symbol waveform
